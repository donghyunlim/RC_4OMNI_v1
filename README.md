1. git pull  
After your pulling, you have to sync my submodule 'rpi_common_module'.  
Ask permisson to donny, and then, you can sync via two line commands.  
   > sudo git submodule init  
   > sudo git submodule update  

Then, every submodule that I registered are going to pulling on your directory.
